        </ul>
        It is in our legitimate interests to provide our services to you, including making available your details to appropriate
        clients and, generally, on our website, as we are paid by our clients for introducing suitable candidates to them. If you
        fail to provide personal information If you fail to provide information when requested, which is necessary for us to
        provide our services (such as evidence of qualifications or work history), we will not be able to provide our services

        <p>

        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will use information about your disability status to consider whether we need to notify clients that they will need
            to provide appropriate adjustments during the recruitment process, for example whether adjustments need to be made
            during a test or interview, and to notify such clients where appropriate.
          </li>
          <li>
            Automated decision-making We use algorithms to match you to suitable opportunities. You have the right to object to us
            processing your personal information in this way by deleting your account, but if you object, we will not be able to
            provide you with our services.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          {' '}
          Data sharing Why might you share my personal information with third parties? We will only share your personal
          information with the following third parties for the purposes of providing our services:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Our clients, either directly or by putting your details on our website, which is accessible by our clients.</li>
          <li>
            Third-party service providers, which we use to provide our services. We will require our clients to respect the
            security of your personal data and to treat it in accordance with the law. However, our clients will be controllers of
            your personal information once we have disclosed it to them, as they will be reviewing it and using it for their own
            purposes. They will be covered by the relevant data protection legislation as controllers of that data. We recommend
            you review their privacy policies for details of how they will store and use your personal information.
          </li>
          <li>
            All our third-party service providers are required to take appropriate security measures to protect your personal
            information in line with their standard terms. We do not allow our third-party service providers to use your personal
            data for their own purposes. We only permit them to process your personal data for specified purposes and in
            accordance with our instructions.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>International Transfers</p>
        Some of our third-party party service providers are based outside the European Economic Area (EEA) so their processing of
        your personal data will involve a transfer of data outside the EEA.
        <p>
          {' '}
          Whenever we transfer your personal data out of the EEA, we ensure a similar degree of protection is afforded to it by
          ensuring at least one of the following safeguards is implemented:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            We will only transfer your personal data to countries that have been deemed to provide an adequate level of protection
            for personal data by the European Commission. For further details, see European Commission: Adequacy of the protection
            of personal data in non-EU countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where we use certain service providers, we may use specific contracts approved by the European Commission which give
            personal data the same protection it has in Europe. For further details, see European Commission: Model contracts for
            the transfer of personal data to third countries.
          </li>
          <li>
            Where we use providers based in the US, we may transfer data to them if they are part of the Privacy Shield which
            requires them to provide similar protection to personal data shared between the Europe and the US. For further
            details, see European Commission: EU-US Privacy Shield. Please contact us info@talrise.com if you want further
            information on the specific mechanism used by us when transferring your personal data out of the EEA.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Data security</p>
        We have put in place appropriate security measures to prevent your personal information from being accidentally lost, used
        or accessed in an unauthorised way, altered or disclosed. In addition, we limit access to your personal information to
        those employees, agents, contractors and other third parties who have a business need-to-know. Except for our clients (who
        will be controllers of your data), they will only process your personal information on our instructions and they are
        subject to a duty of confidentiality. We have put in place procedures to deal with any suspected data security breach and
        will notify you and any applicable regulator of a suspected breach where we are legally required to do so.
        <p> Data retention</p>
        How long will you use my information for? We will retain your personal information and securely destroy it in accordance
        with our data retention policy and applicable laws and regulations. Generally, this would mean that we would retain your
        personal data until you ask us to delete it so that the information is readily available should you wish to pursue further
        opportunities by means of our Services. Your data will only be made available to clients while your profile is “live” on
        our system. At all other times, your data will be stored, but not used, by us, unless you have opted in to our marketing.
        <br />

        <ul>
          <li>
            Request access to your personal information (commonly known as a "data subject access request"). This enables you to

          </li>
          <li>

            ground. You also have the right to object where we are processing your personal information for direct marketing
            purposes.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request the restriction of processing of your personal information. This enables you to ask us to suspend the
            processing of personal information about you, for example if you want us to establish its accuracy or the reason for
            processing it.
          </li>
          <li>
            Request the transfer of your personal information to another party. If you want to review, verify, correct or request
            erasure of your personal information, object to the processing of your personal data, or request that we transfer a
            copy of your personal information to another party, please contact info@talrise.com in writing.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Right to withdraw consent</p>

        purposes of making your personal information available to our clients and identifying suitable job opportunities for you.
        You have the right to withdraw your consent for processing for that purpose at any time. To withdraw your consent, please

        <p>
          Marketing We strive to provide you with choices regarding certain personal data uses, particularly around marketing and
          advertising. We have established the following personal data control mechanisms:
        </p>
        Promotional offers from us

        We may use your Identity, Contact, Technical, Usage and Profile Data to form a view on what we think you may want or need,

        will receive marketing communications from us if you have requested information from us or we have provided services to
        you in the past, and, in each case, you have not opted out of receiving that marketing.
        <br />
        Third-party marketing
        <br />
        We will get your express opt-in consent before we share your personal data with any third party for marketing purposes.
